# Giraffe
we propose Giraffe, a scalable distributed coordination service. There are three important contributions in our design. (1) Giraffe organizes coordination servers using interior-node- disjoint trees for better scalability. (2) Giraffe employs a novel Paxos protocol for strong consistency and fault-tolerance. (3) Giraffe supports hierarchical data organization and in-memory storage for high throughput and low latency.
